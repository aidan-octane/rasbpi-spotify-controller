# rasbpi-spotify-controller
An automatic Spotify controller running on a Raspberry Pi.

Built using the Spotipy library.

This project is so much cooler than it sounds. I can't really find a way to simply describe it other than "automatic Spotify controller." However, my end vision for this project is as follows:

This device will run on a Raspberry Pi and interface with a repurposed vintage radio. I'm going to gut the radio and rewire the cool knobs, buttons, and switches into the Pi. It'll feature buttons/knobs to adjust volume, change playlist, change listening mode from "background" (ambient music) to "listening" (the playlists consisting of the bands I listen to), and more. However, the main feature is the autonomy of it.
Basically, the device will work by recognizing when I come home from work/classes for the day. For this, I'll use the Scapy library to identify when my phone connects to my apartment Wi-Fi. Then, it'll auto-play my desired playlist (which can easily be changed with the radio user-interface) softly from speakers located around my room, effectively creating music with no identifiable source in the room. So, when I enter my room after a long day, I'll effectively enter my room to a movie scene. For me, at least, removing the need to physically turn on music will make me feel like the main character in a movie. 

Come on - wouldn't it be cool to enter your door, sigh, and then drop your bag down roughly? You walk over to the window and reach into your pocket, pulling out a pipe. "Chez le photographe du motel" (from the original film "Ascenseur pour l'echafaud") plays softly from the background of the scene. Dragging from the oak-colored mouthpiece, you gaze out into downtown Chicago. A few neon lights poke back at you, but for the most part, the city is dark - perhaps even black-and-white. There's something bad about to happen tonight...you can feel it. 

See? With just a simple music change, I'm no longer a lanky 19-year old Will Toledo lookalike coming home from failing a Discrete Structures quiz - I'm a Noir detective, musing over the latest impossible-to-solve murder case! 

This project is a major WIP, mostly because I'm having trouble finding a Raspberry Pi.
